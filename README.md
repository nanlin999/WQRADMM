# WQRADMM
R package for distributed quantile regression in longitudinal big data based on multi-block ADMM.

It can be used to reproduce the simulation studies in the following paper:

**Ye Fan, Nan Lin and Liqun Yu**. *Distributed Quantile Regression for Longitudinal Big Data.*

Two main functions are included: **WQRADMMCPP( )** and **paraWQRADMMCPP( )**, designed for the non-distributed and distributed implementation, repectively. Please see file "WQRADMM.cpp" in folder
