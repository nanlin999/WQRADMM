# WQRADMM
R package for longitudinal quantile regression in distributed big data based on multi-block ADMM.

It can be used to reproduce the simulation studies in the following paper:

**Ye Fan, Nan Lin and Liqun Yu**. *Distributed Quantile Regression for Longitudinal Big Data.*

Two main functions are included: **WQRADMM( )** and **paraWQRADMM( )**, designed for the distributed and the non-distributed computation, repectively.
